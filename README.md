QuartzLib
==========

Helper library for Bukkit plugins development.
----

###### (Formerly known as zLib)

### How to use this library in your plugin?

If you are using Maven to build your plugin, follow these simple steps. Other builds methods are not supported (but you can use them of course).  
Currently, QuartzLib requires **Java 8** or later and **Bukkit 1.15** or later.

#### I'm starting a new plugin

Either create a plugin as usual and add the QuartzLib as explained below, or use [the plugin bootstrap generator](https://github.com/zDevelopers/zLib-CodeGen-Utils#plugins-bootstrap-generator) and answer “yes” when the tool asks if you want to use QuartzLib.

#### I want to add QuartzLib to an existing project

1. Add our Maven repository to your `pom.xml` file.
  
    ```xml
        <repository>
            <id>QuartzLib</id>
            <url>https://maven.zcraft.fr/QuartzLib</url>
        </repository>
    ```

2. Add QuartzLib as a dependency.
  
    ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>fr.zcraft</groupId>
            <artifactId>quartzlib</artifactId>
            <version>0.99-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    ```
    
3. Add the shading plugin to the build. Replace **`YOUR.OWN.PACKAGE`** with your own package.
  
   ```xml
        <build>
            ...
            <plugins>
                ...
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.4</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <artifactSet>
                            <includes>
                                <include>fr.zcraft:quartzlib</include>
                            </includes>
                        </artifactSet>
                        <relocations>
                            <relocation>
                                <pattern>fr.zcraft.quartzlib</pattern>
                                <shadedPattern>YOUR.OWN.PACKAGE</shadedPattern>
                            </relocation>
                        </relocations>
                    </configuration>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <phase>package</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>shade</goal>
                            </goals>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
                ...
            </plugins>
            ...
        </build>
   ```
   
4. Build your project as usual, as example with the following command from your working directory, or using an integrated tool from your IDE.
  
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

You should also update your code, so your main class extends [`QuartzPlugin`](https://zdevelopers.github.io/QuartzLib/?fr/zcraft/quartzlib/core/QuartzPlugin.html) instead of `JavaPlugin`. No other changes are required. This will allow you to use directly some useful methods to load your plugin's components.
