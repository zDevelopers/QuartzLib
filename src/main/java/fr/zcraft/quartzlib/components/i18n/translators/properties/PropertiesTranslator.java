 *     <li>
 *         This translator <strong>does not</strong> support plurals. If plurals are used, the first

 *     <li>{@code meta-reports}: the person to contact if translation errors are found.</li>

 * <p>If you need these keys in your properties files, you can add the {@code quartzlib-i18n-no-metadata}
 * key in the file somewhere, with a non-empty value. The keys above will in this case no longer be
