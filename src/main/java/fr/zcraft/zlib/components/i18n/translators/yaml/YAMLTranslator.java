/**
 * Loads translations stored in a YAML file.
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *     <li>
 *         This translator <strong>does not</strong> support plurals. If plurals are used, the first
 *         string will always be used, and the other, ignored.
 *     </li>
 *
 *     <li>
 *         This translator <strong>does</strong> support contexts. The context is the superkey in the
 *         YAML structure (see below). Without context, the default one is {@code keys}.
 *     </li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h3>YAML structure</h3>
 *
 * <p>The YAML structure must be this one:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     author: "The author name."
 *     team: "The translation team name. Defaults to the author if undefined."
 *     reports: "The contact to use to report translation errors. Defaults to the author if undefined."
 *
 *     keys:
 *         greetings:
 *             hi: "Hi there"
 *             how: "How are you?"
 *     other_context:
 *         greetings:
 *             hi: "Hi!"
 * </pre>
 *
 * With this structure, the keys are retrieved as follow:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@link I#t I.t}("greetings.hi")                       # Returns "Hi there"
 *     {@link I#t I.t}("greetings.how")                      # Returns "How are you?"
 *     {@link I#tc I.tc}("other_context", "greetings.hi")    # Returns "Hi!"
 * </pre>
