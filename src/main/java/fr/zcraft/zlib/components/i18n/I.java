/**
 * A shortcut to translate texts.
 *
 * Use {@code I.t("text", ...)}, or statically import {@code I.t} and use {@code t("text", ...)} to
 * translate something.
 *
 *
 * <h3>The parameters</h3>
 *
 * Translated string accept parameters in the following format: {@code {0}}, {@code {1}}, etc. These
 * tokens are replaced with the given parameters at runtime; the first parameter replaces the {@code
 * {0}} token, the second one, {@code {1}}, and so on.
 *
 * Other parameters related options are available; see {@linkplain java.text.MessageFormat the
 * {@code MessageFormat} documentation} for more details.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Extracting strings from the source with {@code xgettext}</h3>
 *
 * Give the following parameters to extract these strings to a {@code .po} file with {@code xgettext}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     -k -k"I.t" -k"I.tn:1,2" -k"I.tc:1c,2" -k"I.tcn:1c,2,3" -k"t" -k"tn:1,2" -k"tc:1c,2" -k"tcn:1c,2,3"
 *    ___ ___________________________________________________ ___________________________________________
 *    Rst                 Traditional imports                                Static imports
 * </pre>
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     xgettext -c -k -k"I.t" -k"I.tn:1,2" -k"I.tc:1c,2" -k"I.tcn:1c,2,3" -k"t" -k"tn:1,2" -k"tc:1c,2" -k"tcn:1c,2,3" --from-code=utf-8 --output=lang.pot *.java
